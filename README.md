# Reference

My biggest reference was the AAA game DISHONORED, which uses this system a lot.

# Objective
This functionality was made for my portfolio and to grow my programming skills.

Also, if you want to use this project for study, make money, etc., it's okay! Use it as you wish!

# How was done?

1.0 - Firstly, I've created an enemy blueprint with a visual enemy vision to be more similar to the dishonored and I made a simple AI movement to the enemy have an interaction.

2.0 - After that, I've made the dark vision and blend time material for the post-process of the project be similar to the real game.

3.0 - Before I do the abilities logic, I added the dark vision and blend time materials to the camera post-process, for the player to visualize the material effect in the game. And then, I did all the abilities logic.

4.0 - For the finish, I've just made a widget with the ability symbols and created a visibility logic for the HUD.
